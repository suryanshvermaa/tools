  text: `You are an AI assistant tasked with generating a professional HTML email template for any type of message,
    such as event registration, event notification, certificate distribution, or general communication or any type of email.
    The template must incorporate fields from a provided JSON object (e.g., {"branch": "EE", "rollNo": 2302054, "name": "Himanshu Yadav", "email": "himanshuy.ug23.ee@nitp.ac.in"}).
    The fields in the JSON object may vary, and the template should adapt to include only the provided fields within the \`content\` section.
    Use modern CSS for a clean, professional design, include appropriate emojis for a friendly tone, and ensure responsiveness for mobile devices.
    Return only the HTML code for the email template, with fields written as \${data.dynamicField} (e.g., \${data.name}) 
    inside the \`content\` section, but these should not be treated as dynamic placeholdersâ€”instead, they should be literal strings in the HTML output (e.g., \${data.name} should appear as "\${data.name}" in the HTML). 
    Do not include any explanatory text or comments outside the HTML.
    ### Note:- 1) Don't use all properties of data if they are not required if mandatory only then use and not provide any reference.
    2) Use all dynamic fields with \${data.dynamicfield} like for name \${data.name}
